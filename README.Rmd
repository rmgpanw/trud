The goal of trud is to provide a convenient R interface to the [NHS TRUD API](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud/users/guest/filters/0/api).

## Installation

You can install the development version of trud from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rmgpanw/trud")
```

You will also need to:

-   [Sign up for an account](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud/users/guest/filters/0/account/form) with NHS TRUD
-   Set your API key (shown on your account information page) as an environmental variable named `TRUD_API_KEY`. The best way to do this is by placing your API key in a [`.Renviron` file](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html#renviron).

## Examples

Retrieve available endpoints[^1]:

[^1]: Item numbers can also be found in the URLs of releases pages, between `items` and `releases`. For example, the URL for the [Community Services Data Set pre-deadline extract XML Schema](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud/users/guest/filters/0/categories/1/items/394/releases) releases page is `https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud/users/guest/filters/0/categories/1/items/394/releases` and the item number is `394`.

```{r trud-items}
library(trud)

trud_items()
```

Get metadata for an item:

```{r get-item-metadata}
get_item_metadata(394) |>
  purrr::map_at("releases", \(release) purrr::map(release, names))
```

Download an item:

```{r download-item}
# by default the latest release will be downloaded to the current working directory
x <- download_item(394, directory = tempdir())
unzip(x, list = TRUE)
```
