The goal of `trud` is to provide a convenient R interface to the [National Health Service (NHS) England Technology Reference data Update Distribution (TRUD)](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud/users/guest/filters/0/api).

The NHS TRUD service provides essential reference files that underpin a wide range of electronic health record (EHR) areas, both in the UK and internationally. These files include clinical coding systems such as ICD, Read codes, prescription codes, and the SNOMED CT ontology, with regular updates to reflect new knowledge and changes in clinical practice. NHS TRUD content supports key research areas like disease phenotyping, cohort selection, epidemiology, health services research, and the development of risk prediction models.

`trud` enables seamless, programmatic retrieval and updating of NHS TRUD release items, removing the need for manual downloads and reducing the risk of errors or version drift. This helps researchers maintain reproducible, up-to-date analyses â€” whether as part of ad-hoc studies or automated pipelines.

To learn more about NHS TRUD and its available resources, visit the [NHS TRUD website](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud).

## Installation

You can install this package from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("trud")
```

Or you can install the development version  of `trud` from [GitHub](https://github.com/rmgpanw/trud) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("rmgpanw/trud")
```

You will also need to [sign up for a free account](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud/users/guest/filters/0/account/form) with NHS TRUD and set up your API key as described in `vignette("trud")`.

## Getting Started

### Understanding TRUD Subscriptions

**Important**: NHS TRUD operates on a subscription model. After creating your account, you must individually subscribe to each item you want to access through the [NHS TRUD website](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud/users/guest/filters/0/categories/1).

### Recommended Workflow

**Step 0**: Set up your TRUD API key as an environmental variable named `TRUD_API_KEY`. For example, create or edit your project `.Renviron` file with `usethis::edit_r_environ()`, then populate as follows (replacing `e963cc518cc41500e1a8940a93ffc3c0915e2983` with your own API key):[^1]

[^1]: You will also need to restart your R session to set any environmental variables that have been newly-added to your project `.Renviron` file.

```
TRUD_API_KEY=e963cc518cc41500e1a8940a93ffc3c0915e2983
```

**Step 1**: Check what you're already subscribed to:

```{r subscribed-items}
library(trud)

# See items you can currently access
get_subscribed_metadata()
```

**Step 2**: Browse all available items (note: subscription required for access):

```{r browse-items}
# List all available TRUD items
trud_items()
```

**Step 3**: Subscribe to additional items you need via the [NHS TRUD website](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud/users/guest/filters/0/categories/1), then access them:

```{r access-items, eval=FALSE}
# After subscribing to an item (e.g., item 394), you can:

# Get metadata
metadata <- get_item_metadata(394)

# Download the item
file_path <- download_item(394, directory = tempdir())
```

## Available functionality

The main functions provided by `trud` are:

- `get_subscribed_metadata()`: Shows items you can currently access
- `trud_items()`: Lists all available items
- `get_item_metadata()`: Retrieves metadata for a specific item
- `download_item()`: Downloads files for a specific item

Please see `vignette("trud")` for further information and getting started.
